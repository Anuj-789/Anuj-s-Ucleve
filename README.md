**Project Idea:**  
This is my personal front-end project built for **Ucleve Traders**, a smart and trusted scrap trading company founded by Anuj Kumar. The website is designed to inform users about services, sustainability, and accessibility.  

The **main motive** of this platform is to help people **sell their scrap easily from their homes** without going anywhere. Ucleve provides **doorstep scrap pickup**, fair pricing, and instant payment—making the entire process simple and convenient for everyone.
